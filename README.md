## 1. Problem Background

Students and staff at the university encounter significant challenges when it comes to locating and utilizing campus resources, such as study spaces, computer labs, and faculty offices. The current system for discovering and managing campus events is fragmented, leading to missed opportunities and low engagement. The absence of a centralized platform for accessing both resources and events results in frustration, underutilization, and a disconnected campus experience.

## 2. Target

The goal is to develop a Campus Resource and Event Management App that increases resource utilization by 25% and boosts student event participation by 30% within the first semester. The app aims to provide a one-stop solution for booking campus facilities and staying updated on events, ultimately enhancing student engagement and satisfaction.

## 3. Causes

- **Disjointed Information Sources**: Information about campus resources and events is scattered across multiple platforms, causing confusion and inefficiency.
- **Lack of Real-time Updates**: Students and staff struggle to find real-time availability of resources like study spaces or computer labs.
- **Poor Communication Channels**: Event organizers lack an effective way to reach students and provide timely updates or changes, leading to reduced event attendance.
- **Underutilization of Campus Resources**: The difficulty in locating and booking resources results in many facilities remaining underused.

## 4. Countermeasures

- **Centralized Platform**: Develop an app that consolidates information about campus resources and events, making it easily accessible to students and staff.
- **Real-time Availability and Booking**: Implement a feature that displays the real-time availability of campus resources and allows users to book them directly through the app.
- **Event Management Tools**: Provide event organizers with tools to create, promote, and manage events, including RSVP tracking and notifications.
- **Navigation and Assistance**: Incorporate a map and navigation feature to help users quickly find resources and event locations on campus.

## 5. Evaluation

The success of the app will be evaluated by tracking key metrics such as:

- Resource booking rates
- Event attendance figures
- User satisfaction through surveys and app usage data

These metrics will help assess whether the app meets the target increases in resource utilization and event participation. Feedback from users will be gathered to identify areas for improvement.

## 6. Action/Standardization

If the app achieves its goals, it will be established as the university's standard platform for managing campus resources and events. Guidelines for continuous improvement will be created based on user feedback. The possibility of integrating additional features, such as academic calendars or campus news, will be explored to further enhance the app's functionality and user engagement.

## 7. Recommended Team Structure

- **Development Team (30-35 students)**:
  - Frontend Developers
  - Backend Developers
  - Mobile App Developers

- **UI/UX Design Team (6-8 students)**:
  - Responsible for creating the app's visual elements and interactive tools for developers.

- **Project Management Team (4-6 students)**:
  - Scrum Masters/Project Managers to oversee the project.

- **Data Management and Analytics Team (3-4 students)**:
  - Ensuring data security, accessibility, and efficient organization.
